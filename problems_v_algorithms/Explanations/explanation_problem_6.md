## Explanation

For this problem, we simply traverse an array once, comparing elements of the array and saving the lower and greater numbers respectively.

## Time complexity

We traverse an entire array, for a complexity of O(n).

## Space complexity

We only save a minimum value and a maximum value here, which accomplishes a constant
space complexity: O(1).
