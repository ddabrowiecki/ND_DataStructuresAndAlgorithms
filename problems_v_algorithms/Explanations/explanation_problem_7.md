## Explanation

For this problem, we implement a trie, creating a class with insert and find methods.  We then use these methods for our Router class.

## Time complexity

The time complexity of this solution requires that we take into account the number of paths
included (n) as well as the average length of the paths (L), in big O notation: O(n*L).
