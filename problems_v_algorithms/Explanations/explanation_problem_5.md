## Explanation

For this problem, we implemented a trie, using recursion to recursively capture suffixes of words saved in the trie.

## Time complexity

The time complexity of this solution requires that we take into account the number of words
included (n) as well as the average length of the word (L), in big O notation: O(n*L).
